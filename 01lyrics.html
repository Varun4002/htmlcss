            Now he's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
            Is it that sweet? I guess so
            Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
            That's that me espresso
            Move it up, down, left, right, oh
            Switch it up like Nintendo
            Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
            That's that me espresso

            I can't relate to desperation
            My 'give-a-fucks' are on vacation
            And I got this one boy, and he won't stop calling
            When they act this way, I know I got 'em
            Too bad your ex don't do it for ya
            Walked in and dream-came-trued it for ya
            Soft skin and I perfumed it for ya (yes)
            I know I Mountain Dew it for ya (yes)
            That morning coffee, brewed it for ya (yes)
            One touch and I brand-newed it for ya
            Now he's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
            Is it that sweet? I guess so
            Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
            That's that me espresso
            
            Move it up, down, left, right, oh
            Switch it up like Nintendo
            Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
            That's that me espresso
            Is it that sweet? I guess so
            I'm working late 'cause I'm a singer
            Oh, he looks so cute wrapped around my finger
            My twisted humor make him laugh so often
            My honey bee, come and get this pollen
            Too bad your ex don't do it for ya
            Walked in and dream-came-trued it for ya
            Soft skin and I perfumed it for ya (yes)
            I know I Mountain Dew it for ya (yes)
            That morning coffee, brewed it for ya (yes)
            One touch and I brand-newed it for ya (stupid)
            Now he's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
            Is it that sweet? I guess so
            Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
            That's that me espresso
            Move it up, down, left, right, oh
            Switch it up like Nintendo
            Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
            That's that me espresso (yes)
            Thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
            Is it that sweet? I guess so (yes)
            Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
            That's that me espresso (yes)
            Move it up, down, left, right, oh
            Switch it up like Nintendo (yes)
            Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
            That's that me espresso
            Is it that sweet? I guess so
            Mm, that's that me espresso
